I worked on a project that involved analyzing a dataset of Facebook ad campaigns. The dataset was obtained from a source and was in CSV format. The dataset contained information about the ad campaigns, such as campaign name, ad set name, impressions, clicks, spend, and conversions.

However, the dataset had missing values, which needed to be cleaned before it could be analyzed. I used Python and the Pandas library to clean the dataset. I removed rows with missing values and filled in missing values in other columns using various techniques like imputation.

After cleaning the dataset, I conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the performance of the ad campaigns. I used visualizations such as bar plots, line plots, and scatter plots to visualize the data and identify trends and patterns.
            Using Power BI to understand the pattern and importance of the rate is a great approach to gain insights into the data. Power BI is a powerful business analytics tool that allows you to connect to a wide range of data sources, visualize data, and create interactive dashboards and reports.


The following metrics can be used to create the perfect campaign for the best outcomes:

Male and female (both)
30 to 49 years old (inclusive of all four age bands)

Interest1: 16
Interest2: 19
Interest3:20
By slightly changing the interests, we can test out various campaigns. Following is a list of potential interests:

1st Interest: 10, 15, and 29
20 Interest
Attention3: 17, 31, and 33
